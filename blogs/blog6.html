            >My ideal IT workplace is one that is small and flexible, one where I can focus completely on the project
            and its eventual worth. I believe that such a workplace is very difficult to find, especially in Netherlands,
            Nevertheless, Here are 3 companies that have piqued my interest, they are: Sever, Finitude, and Lost relic games.</p>
            <p style="color:beige; text-align: center; font-size: 120%;"
            >Since both of these companies are videogame related, the job positions will gravitate towards either specific
            roles such as tester, narrative designer, programmer, visual artist etc., or it will be a combination of roles that
            will converge on it just being a "Developer", a developer would just do all the specific things I mentioned.

            >Studio sever mainly develops indie and educational videogames, based in Tomsk-Russia, the roles of the workers
            are specific, things like project manager, tester or sound desginer, 2D artist etc. they mainly use the Unity game engine for
            their projects, their environment seems to be a semi-proffesional studio type environment, where there isn't much
            business-like stuff going around. their motto is: "We Craft Games with Anguish" I would love to work here for a
            couple of reasons, firstly because they are a close-knit company of no more than 15 people, secondly, they make
            the best games, thirdly, Tomsk is a very good place, the only obstacle for me would be my lack of russian, and not enough
            blood and fat to protect me from the cold.

            >Finitude is a 2 man indie studio based in Maastricht and Berlin, the job roles are mainly whole, meaning 
            a single person needs to be able to do a lot of specific things at once, i.e: Developer. their choice of IT
            solutions remain unknown, but they do use game engines to make their projects, their environment doesn't seem
            to be a studio, instead they work individually from their homes, their company is entirely indie, and no 
            resemblance of business-like structure can be found. Their focus seems to lie with making their "dream game", with historical experiences being
            put through the lense of videogames. I can see myself working here, but not as a fullblown developer, instead I would
            probably apply for a specific role. Their taste and ambition really speak to me, and I see a lot of potential,
            so much so that I can't just leave them be...

            >Lost relic games is a single person indie dev studio based in Australia, the job roles much like Finitude are not specific,
            instead requiring a combined expertise of being a whole indie developer, the work is done individually at a home studio. 
            The Unity game engine is their preferred tool to make their games.
            there is no business-like structure, but unlike the Finitude studio, lost relic games
            is a fulltime endevour and contains a noticible degree of professionalism in it, much like finitude their focus is on
            realising their "dream game". The man behind lost relic games: John Stejskal thought me a lot about game dev and life,
            for which I would like to work with him in order to realise his "dream game" I've been watching him for 4-5 years now, and been closely
            tracking his progress, The only way I could feasibly work at his studio would be to do it remotely, other than that, I don't think
            it's practical for me to pursue such a career appointment.

            They would like to craft something that will hold worth, and for that, I couldn't ask for more.
