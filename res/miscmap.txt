━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━[Why HZ HBO-ICT?]━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Generally speaking, job security, financial
certainty, expertise gain, environmental
opportunities, and relationship dynamics
are the main reasons why I'm attending
this programme. 


An education in ICT for me is Ideal, since
computers are the only things I'm somewhat
capable in, nothing else would probably work
for me as smoothly as ICT. I'm also compelled
by it for an important plan I need to do,
some parts of this plan are heavily alligned
with the expertise of the ICT field.


I chose HBO as the educational level.
The practical based approach of a HBO fits my
expertise criteria the best, the diploma it
provides is the only thing I'll probably
ever require for finding and keeping a job for
the rest of my life. Apart from these, the
relational, social, and financial benefits of
enrolling in a HBO programme is damn near required
for me if I'm to continue on with my plans.


I chose HZ mainly because it had the sort of
programme I was after, and because the
institution is small and flexible. Also,
my personal circumstances at the time weren't
all that ideal, at the end of the day, no one
else would accept me except HZ, twice...
